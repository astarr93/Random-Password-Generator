# Random-Password-Generator

This is a simple random password generator that will change the result based on the user's selections.

You can create a random password between 8 and 128 characters using any combination of:

* Uppercase Letters
* Lowercase Letters
* Special Characters
* Numbers

I've also added validation and recursion to ensure the password will meet the minimum requirements.
